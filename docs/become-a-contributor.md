## Become a Contributor

Here are some ways you can help:

* "[Watch](https://github.com/achow101/btcinformation.org/subscription)" this
  repository to be notified of issues and Pull Requests (PRs) that could use
  your attention.

    Alternatively, email volunteer coordinator Andrew Chow
    ([admin@btcinformation.org](mailto:admin@btcinformation.org))
    with a short list of your interests and skills, and they will email you when
    there's an issue or PR that could use your attention.

* Help [write new documentation](contributing-to-developer-documentation.md)
  for the [developer documentation pages](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-documentation),
  or **[review PRs adding new documentation](https://github.com/achow101/btcinformation.org/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Dev+Docs%22).**
  You don't need to be a Bitcoin expert to review a PR---these docs are written
  for non-experts, so we need to know if non-experts find them confusing or
  incomplete. If you review a PR and don't find any problems worth commenting
  about, leave a "Looks Good To Me (LGTM)" comment.

* [Submit new wallets](managing-wallets.md)
  for the [Choose Your Wallet page](https://btcinformation.org/en/choose-your-wallet) or
  help us [review wallet submissions](https://github.com/achow101/btcinformation.org/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Awallet+is%3Apr).

* [Translate Btcinformation.org into another language](assisting-with-translations.md)
  using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/btcinformationorg/) or help
  review new and updated translations.

* Help improve Bitcoin.org another way. Email volunteer coordinators Andrew Chow ([admin@btcinformation.org](mailto:admin@btcinformation.org))
  or Dave Harding ([dave@dtrt.org](mailto:dave@dtrt.org)) to let us know how
  what you're interested in and how you'd like to get involved.
